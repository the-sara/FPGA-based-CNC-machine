# FPGA-based-CNC-machine
design, simulation and implementation of an FPGA based  computer numerical control, CNC, logic controller.
The digital controller is synthesized with very high speed integrated circuit hardware 
description language, VHDL, and housed in the EP2C35, an FPGA of the cyclone
II family.
Timing simulation is performed to test the feasibility of the controller. A physical CNC 
prototype machine has been constructed in the laboratory to verify its functionality
